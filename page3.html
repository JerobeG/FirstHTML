                <h1><b>How Can We Minimize the Impact of Computer Production?</b></h1>
             <ol>
          <li>Produce products that use less amount of electricity</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Intel and AMD announced that instead of creating products that are faster than their predecessors, they will focus on creating products that are the same speed but use less electricity
          </li>
          <li>Using less electricity will reduce the amount of greenhouse gasses used</li>
        </ul>
          <li>Green Manufacturing</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
          <li>Green manufacturing the process of using less natural resources to create a product</li>
          <li>Computers require natural resources like lead and mercury, which can only be obtained from mining from produces greenhouse gasses</li>
          <li>Reducing these resources where the only way of obtaining them cause greenhouse gasses will obviously reduce greenhouse gasses</li>
        </ul>
        <h1><b>How Can We Reduce The Impact That Our Usage of Computer Has on The Enviornment?</b></h1>
        <ol><li>Stop disposing computers</li>
        <ul>
          <li>disposing computers will always lead to them being burned which will unfortunately create toxic particles that will go into the environment </li>
          <li>There are specific companies who collect computers people don't want anymore, and dismantle them for good use</li>
        </ul>
          <li>Use computers that use less electricity</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Computers vary in the amount of electricity, for example a computer with the same components as another one, however has a 3050, while the other one has a 4090, will use less power as the 4090 requires more watts therefore using more electricity</li>
            <li>Using less electricity means that less coal will be burned meaning lower amount of greenhouse gasses in the air.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Reduce your electronic use</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Computers use electricity and using electricity will always amount to greenhouse gasses</li>
            <li>the less amount of electricity you use the less amount of greenhouse gasses you will produce</li>
          </ul>
        </ol>
        <h1><b>How Else Can We Reduce the Impact That Computers Have On The Enviornment?</b></h1>
        <ol>
          <li>Purchase longer lasting devices</li>
          <ul>
            <li>It is statistically proven that Iphone users keep their devices for longer than android user.</li>
            <li>Iphones last much longer than samsung phones</li>
            <li>Reusing electronics will use cause you to throw them out less which we know hurts the enviornment</li>
          </ul>
         <li> Certain people accept hardware that you don't want anymore </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
          <li>This Could be a Charity and People who might need these hardware will use them</li>
          <li>If it's broke certain people usually dismantle them, and repair them to reuse</li>
          <li>This will reduce greenhouse gasses as no computer will be burned </li>
        </ul>
